# Trip Hopper

----

### [Live App](https://triphopper.herokuapp.com)


> This app will allow you to build and save trips by using the most recent location of your trip as the search location for the next part of the trip. This makes for a fun and easy way to hop from place to place on your trip. Google Maps is also intigrated into each location, which also gives you the ability to preview each location in "street view".

> This is a fork of a group project ([See Original Here](https://github.com/shay-kennedy/trip-hopper-cap)) I completed during an intensive coding bootcamp. After graduation, I wanted to continue iterating over the project without losing the original design.
